					One evening a friend sent me an email late at night stating that after an extensive Internet search, he had finally found the guitar effects pedal used in the Wilco song "I'm them Man Who Loves You." The bad news, it was made by a company in Britain that went out of business in the 90's and thus goes for over $500 now. I knew the actual components inside such an effects pedal were dirt cheap, so I searched the Internet further and found a company that sells kits for building a clone for $90. A little more searching, and I found a <a href='http://hownotomakeapedal.blogspot.com/2011_07_01_archive.html'>blog</a> with a veroboard layout of of the circuit. I am not much of a guitar player myself, but I wanted to gain some experience with soldering and my friend was down to foot the bill. $60 and and a lot of soldering later, I had a pedal.

				 	I visited this friend last weekend to test the pedal, and after discovering that effects pedals work with tip negative DC power input-- and replacing some op-amps-- I'm happy to say that the pedal was successfully cloned.
