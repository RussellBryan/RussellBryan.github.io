			<h3>Whats Going On Here?</h3>
			<p>
				I've always wanted to build my own guitar or bass and years ago, a friend and I began talking about making a bass out of acrylic plastic. Recently, my father acquired a 1994 Haas CNC mill and I gained the capability of actually making this happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first thing I realized is that thick Acrylic is quite expensive. For this reason, I opted to make the bass flying V shaped so that I could buy a rectangle of 1 1/2 inch acyclic, cut it diagonally, flip and glue it such that I end up with a triangle. With this method, I could use about half as much material as needed for a normal body shape as long as I could tolerate a seam down the middle. The cost of the acrylic came out to just over $200. (Thus I found it to be very much worth it to have a seam in the middle.)
			</p>
			<p>
				I split a 2 by 10 the same way to use as a clamping fixture, milled my edges so they were nice and flat, and bolted everything down to the machine bed. I ended up with a clean clear joint I was quite happy with. 
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came time to machine it, I ran into some difficulties with the size of the mill. The mill travel on the Haas VF2 is 30 inches buy 15 inches. My triangle was 26 by 18. Thus multiple set ups per side were necessary. The size of the machine bed also made clamping difficult. I ended up running 3 programs per side, moving clamps and/or rotating the stock in between each. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I sanded off all the machining marks with 600 grit sand paper and flamed it with an acetylene torch. I found the high heat of the acetylene torch made it easier to melt the surface without over heating the whole piece. I finished it with some polish and a buffing wheel and was able to get it clear as water. 
			</p>
			<h3>Future Plans/Improvements</h3>
			<p>
				There's not much I can do to improve it now, but there are a few things I would do differently. First of, I got some small surface fracture dents from the fly-cutter. I had the cutter sharpened to a point, I think a small radius would have been gentler on the acrylic. If I surface acrylic again, I'll be sure to be very gentle with it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I also learned the hard way that acrylic glue joints don't take well to flame polishing. The gas in the tiny invisible bubbles expand and make them visible bubbles. Had I known this before hand I would have just flamed the pockets and polished more with the buffing wheel. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To connect the pickups to the rest of the electronics, I milled a slot diagonally from the pickups to the pocket with all the electronics. If I could redo that, I would take it straight back so that it is partially hidden by the strings and bridge. I've had some interest from a few friends about having me make them a bass or guitar, so I may have the chance to make these improvements.
