				After my first guitar effects pedal was a success, I started looking into others that I could build for way less than thier retail value. My guitarist friend said he always wanted a Clon Centaur, a pedal that is thought to be one of the best distortion pedals ever made and sells for over $1500. After a short internet search I found a company that sells a <a hret="https://aionelectronics.com/project/refractor-centaur-overdrive/">PCB for $10</a>. From there everythin went very smoothly. All the material nescessary cost about $60. The pedal worked, but did not sound quite how it should. It turns the two diodes that do the clipping are shrowded in mystery. The conensus on the internet is that the right sound comes from Russian D9E diodes. However, the pedal was originally made in the 90s and these diodes would not have been available to the designer. The original designer, Bill Finnegan, announced that the diodes he used were 1N34As and its just a matter of finding the right ones. I tried some D9Es, but was unable to get ones with the correct voltage drop. I plan on buying many of a large variety of diodes and trying different ones until I get a great sound.
