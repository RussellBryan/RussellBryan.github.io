			<!Pragraphs Here>
			<p>
				After being inspired by Alton Brown and looking through many DIY guides for building a tandoor, it seamed that the process was as easy as cutting bottom off of a terracotta pot. Being a 22 year old college student, my focus for this (and any) project is functionality and cost over aesthetics. So, I bought a pot and gave it a go. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It just takes an angle grinder with a masonry wheel. It goes much quicker and easier if you soak in water overnight. I've heard it can be done with a hack saw, but I wouldn't want to.
			</p>
			<p>
				I happened to have some pieces of broken terracotta lying around, so I used a few of them around the bottom of the pot to prop it up and get good airflow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I've heard the key here is high intermittent heat. I went with about two minutes in and one minute out. Four iterations turned out about right.
			</p>
			<p>
				The results: Quite good. A little overdone on the bottom, I'll have to be more careful about my positioning next time, but the chicken was excellent none the less.
