					<h3>Whats Going On Here?</h3>
			<p>
				This is my thermo-circulator, used for sous vide cooking. I built it in the summer of 2015 and recently added a Particle Photon so it can be controlled from my phone. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The design is very simple (and pretty cheap). A cambro, immersion heater and, aquarium pump (admitedly not the best solution, but for $8 I'm not complaining). To control it, I set up a GFCI outlet in a junction box with a relay and hooked everything up to a Particle Photon with a digital temperature probe. I wrote my own PID control code and after some tuning, I was able to hold temperature as acurately as I could measure it, about .1&deg Celsius. The outlet is not entirely nescesarry, but I wanted to have a device that could control other things as well. All told everything costs about $100 including the Cambro. 
			</p>
			<h3>Future Plans/Improvements</h3>
			<p>
				I'm very happy with how this works. I may write some code that makes it easier and prettier to control with my phone. I may also build a mount that allows me to use any container. However, many circulators have hit the market in the last two years and now go for $150. I may break down and buy one instead of improving this one.
