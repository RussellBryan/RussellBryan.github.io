				After making my tent, the next piece of gear I wanted to upgrade was my sleeping bag. I wanted an to make a down quilt as lite as I could. I wanted something similar the the quilts sold by <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">this company</a>. I found I could buy the fabric I needed from <a href="http://thru-hiker.com/kits/">thru-hiker.com</a> for about $50. The best price for down I could find was from <a href="http://wildernesslogics.com/WHITE-GOOSE-DOWN_c50.htm">wildernesslogistics.com</a> The measurements I took led me to believe I could get away 11 ounces of down which ran me about $90. The sewing went well. I found the straight seams easy after sewing all the complex curves for my tent.

				I tested the quilt on a backpacking trip in Lassen Volcanic National Park. It turned out that I had sized the bag a bit too tightly. It worked, and kept me warm at an outside temperature under 40&deg F, however in order the maintain the warmth, I couldn't move at all. I was trying to make the bag as tight as I could in order to make the lightest bag possible, in hind sight, a few extra ounces would have been well worth the comfort. The bag works perfect as a warm weather bag though. Its perfectly fine for temperatures above 50&deg F and lighter than anything I could have bought. I'm considering getting into hammock backpacking and this would make a perfect top quilt.
