			<h1>What Gooing On Here?</h1>
			<p>
				As I was looking into getting a decesnt espresso grinder, I realized that I could buy the burrs for a Rancilio Rocky grinder for $20 and build my own grinder to fit them. I was originally going to make the ginder hand-crank but I found it was just as easy to use the motor out of my old coffee grider to make it autamatic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The designe is fairly simple. A large piece of aluminum round holds the top burr and funnels the beans towards it. The motor, shaft, and bearings are all mounted to another piece of aluminum which threads into the top. In this way the distance between the burrs is adjustable. 
			</p>
			<h3>Future Plans/imporvements</h3>
			<p>
				I plan on adding a better way to gauge the distance between the burrs to make it easier to hone in on the correct grind. Other than that, I'm happy with how it works. It gives a very consistent, very fine grind size. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My had pleny of aluminum around and and was happy let me use it. All I bought for this project was the burrs, bearings, and screws and switches. Total cost to me was around $40. Had I had to buy the aluminum the cost would have been much higher, but then I would have designed it differently as well. It ultimately took a lot of machining and from a cost standpoint, was not really worth it. However, I was happy for the machining practise and got to learn a couple new skills. (Like single point threading on the lathe.)
