			<h3>Whats Going Here?</h3>
				<p>
				    I love to brew beer, and as I was looking into setting up an all grain brewing system, I realized I could easily put together a temperature controlled recirculated mash system. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The first step in brewing is called mashing. You take malted barley, add water, and hold it at a specified temperature. This allows enzymes in the barley to break down starches into ferment able sugars. The enzyme activity depends greatly on temperature, and different enzyme activity leads to different sugars and byproducts being produced. This ultimately play a huge part in the final character of the beer. Thus the more control the brewer has over the temperature of the mash, the better. If you would like to learn more about the brewing process, I would highly recommend <a href="http://howtobrew.com/">howtobrew.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most home brewers do not have a system that controls temperature during the brewing process and instead manually control temperature by adding hot water through out the brewing process. This method works fine and an attentive brewer can keep the temperature with 1&deg Celsius. With this project, I wanted to see how easily (and cheaply) I could put together a system that would do a better job. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I used my circulator (more info <a href="circulator.html">here</a>) to maintain the temperature of a water bath and submerged 20 feet of 1/4 inch copper tubing. I found a small food-grade pump on amazon for $30 and used it to pump the mash liquid through the copper tubing. I then hooked up two temperature probes to my micro-controller and set up a PID control code for the temperature of the mash liquid. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My mash tun is simply a 24-quart cooler with a copper tubing drain manifold at the bottom. See <a hred="http://howtobrew.com/">howtobrew.com</a> for info on sizing and building a mash tun. Tons of great info there, including potential flow diagrams that show why more drainage tubes are better. 
				</p>
				<h3>Future Plans/Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					I was ultimately quite happy with the result from this set up. I did loose 1/2 a degree Celsius in 90 minutes of mashing. My circulator did not have quite enough power to maintain temperature. I expected this as I was trying to hold roughly 9 gallons of water at around 60 &deg C with 1200 Watts. I plan to eventually put together a system that has plenty of power to even step up temperature during the mashing process. I have a few ideas on how to do this, I may try regulating a propane valve with a servo, or I may due away with the heat exchanger and heat the mash liquid directly. For now a quick fix is the modify the geometry of my circulator and heat exchanger in order to ultimately use less water.
